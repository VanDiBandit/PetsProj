Teacher said "create a ReadMe & push to Github" Ok teach.
My notes I've gathered on the topics: "Know your variables, How objects behave, Serious Polymorphism, & Life and Death of an Object."

Knowing your variables
-There's 2 types of variables:
-Primitive Variables & Reference Variables
-VARIABLES MUST HAVE A TYPE & NAME
-8 Primitive Data Types
-byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean & char
-Primitive Variable is something like: int y =10;
-Reference Variable is something like: Name myVan = new Name;
-Reference Variable is like a remote control using the(.) is like pressing a button on a remote to control access to a method or Instance Variable
-No such thing as a primitive array, only and array that HOLDS primitives.

Objects & Behavior:
-Class describes what an object KNOWS & what an object DOES
-Class is a blueprint for the object
-Instance Variables STATE what an object is
-Methods are what an object DOES
-You can get things back from a method using the Return type
-You can VOID a return but you won't get anything back
-A Method can have more than one value in the method
-MARK INSTANCE VARIABLE PRIVATE
-MARK GETTERS & SETTERS PUBLIC

Serious Polymorphism:
-An abstract class has no use,no value & no purpose unless it is EXTENDED
-if you declare an abstract method, you MUST mark class abstract as well.
-You can have an abstract method in a non-abstract class
-You MUST implement all abstract methods
-Implementing an abstract method is just like overriding a method
-Polymorphism stands for "Many Forms."

Life & death of an object:
-Java has 2 areas of memory: Stack & The Heap
-All local variables live on the stack
-ALL OBJECTS LIVE IN THE HEAP
-Instance variables live withing the object they belong to on the Heap
